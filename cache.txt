-------------------------------------------what is cache management?-----------------------------------------

---------------->    Cache is a type of memory that is used to increase the speed of data access.
---------------->    Normally, the data required for any process resides in the main memory.
---------------->    However, it is transferred to the cache memory temporarily if it is used frequently enough.



-----------------------------------------The cache performance can be explained using the following steps −-------------------------------

----->  If a process needs some data, it first searches in the cache memory.
------> If the data is available in the cache, this is termed as a cache hit and the data is accessed as required.
------> If the data is not in the cache then it is termed as a cache miss. 
------> Then the data is obtained from the main memory. After that the data is transferred to the cache memory under the assumption that it will be needed again.
------>  The performance of the cache is measured using the hit ratio. It is the number of cache hits divided by the total cache accesses. 

----------The formula for this is:--------------

Hit Ratio  =  No.of cache hits /  no.of cache hits +  no.of cache misses

------two types -----

---> primary cache

---------Primary cache is very fast and its access time is similar to the processor registers.
         This is because it is built onto the processor chip. However because of this reason, its size is quite small.
            It is also known as a level 1 cache and is build using static RAM (SRAM).


---> secondary cache

------------->  The secondary cache or external cache is cache memory that is external to the primary cache. 
            It is located between the primary cache and the main memory. 
            It is also known as a level 2 cache and is often housed on the processor chip as well.



------------------------Differences between cookies and cache and session ----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------cookies------------------

Web cookie, also named browser cookie/internet cookies/HTTP cookie, is a small amount of data that is stored on your computer by the web browser
 when you browse a web page. Cookies are used for remembering user’s browsing activity, 
 e.g. clicking specific items or buttons, logging in information like names, passwords, addresses, payment card numbers, visited web pages, etc.

--------------------------------------------cache -------------------------

Web cache, also called HTTP cache, is a tech for storing temporary information like web pages, images, files, scripts or other web multimedia. 
Cache is mainly used to reduce the server lag and reduce the loading speed of web page data.

-------------------------------------------session-------------------------------

In the computing world, 
session is the temporary interactive information between multiple communicating devices or between the user and computer.



----------------------------Difference between Cache and Cookies-----------------------


-------->  Cache’s function is to make the web page load faster while cookie’s function is to track user’s different browsing activities.
--------> Cache is composed of files, images, videos, audio, scripts or other multimedia files of the web pages you visited.
--------> Cookies stores information related to the user’s web browsing activity like user’s preferences, login information, etc.
------> Cache always exists in the user’s computer unless the user manually clears cache of the browser. (Related: how to clear cache for one site). 
------> However, cookies will expire for a period of time, and the user needs to enter the login information again.


------------------------------------Difference between Cookies and Session---------------------------------------------

------> Both cookies and sessions contain user information, but cookies are stored at the client side while sessions are stored on the server-side.
-----> Cookies expire after a period of time while sessions end when a user closes the browser.
-----> The maximum size of cookie is 4KB. However, there is no limit on the size or number of sessions.
-----> Cookies can be disabled but sessions cannot be disabled.
-----> 

Sessions depend on cookies but cookies are not dependent on sessions.
